Search Algorithms

---------------

The purpose of this project is to learn how to implement the different type of search algorithms, namely, linear search, binary search, hashing, and interpolation search. For each program we build a counter to find the number of times each statement is executed. Also, use the result to compare the time complexity of each search algorithm.
